;;; Write a function that takes a number and adds 100 to it
(defn inc-by-100
  [x])

;;; Write a function that works exactly like the function inc-maker except with
;;; subtraction

;;; Write a function that works like map except the return value is a set

;;; Create a function thatâ€™s similar to symmetrize-body-parts except that it
;;; has to work with weird space aliens with radial symmetry. Instead of two
;;; eyes, arms, legs, and so on, they have five
